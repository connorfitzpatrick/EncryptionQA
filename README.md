This project is a text file encryptor that I made in my last year of school. It utilizes the AES Encryption algorithm to transform inputted text. 

When users upload a file, they set a question and answer. For the data to be encrypted or decrypted again, they must correctly answer the question they asked when uploading the file.


cd to project root. Then run `python app.py`
